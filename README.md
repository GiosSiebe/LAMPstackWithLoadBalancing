# LAMPstackWithLoadBalancing
I made a LAMP stack with Docker that runs Apache2 that shows an PHP website, where the index.php file is on the host system. I used an Ubuntu 22.04 virtual machine to run this configuration on. The file takes data out of another container that runs MySQL. I also userd load balancing with nginx.
